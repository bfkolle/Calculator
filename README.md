# Calculator

A calculator application I made over the winter and summer following Computer Science II (Intro to Java Programming and OOP).
As of writing this, the calculator and all major features are complete, and working bug-free (although some are likely to crop up eventually).

Bugs:
  1) Exponents overflow.
  
To-do:
  1) Edit graphics to improve visual appeal.
