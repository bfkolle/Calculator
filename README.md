# Calculator

A calculator application I made over the winter and summer following Computer Science II (Intro to Java Programming and OOP).
As of writing this, the calculator and all major features are complete, and working bug-free (although some are likely to crop up eventually).

Bugs:
  None known
  
To-do:
  1) Edit graphics to improve visual appeal.
  2) Add public to a number of methods that are mysteriously missing it, to improve consistency.
  3) Add more comments.
